## Hi there 👋

Hi! I am Daniel.

💻 I am a self-taught and passionate about the web development I love the back and frontend.

📝In my University carreer I used different technologies as:
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ Node.JS
+ React
+ MongoDB
+ SQL and more.

I have extensive knowledge in programming languajes, relational and non-relational data bases, networks and security.

❤ I love learning, for that I take to courses for different plataforms like Udemy for practice and know more about a language or framework as Node.Js or React. In differents projects I did API's and connect with a data base as MongoDB for users with a nickname and a password but this password have asecuritys layer applying encryption.

My experience is based on University projects where I have been use soft skills and another ones skills where I can mention ones: 
+ Teamwork
+ communication
+ time management and problem solving.

If I dont know something, I will to investigate about it :shipit:
